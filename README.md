# Crypto-Spread-Arbitrage
This repository contains a project that leverages historical data to design and test an arbitrage strategy between spot cryptocurrencies and their perpetual futures counterparts. The goal is to identify opportunities where the spread between spot prices and perpetual futures prices diverge, allowing for potential arbitrage profits.
